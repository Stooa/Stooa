                "firstBlock": "Have you ever felt like you were talking to a screen instead of your colleagues during online meetings? The awkward silence, the lost gazes into the cameras... and the famous \"Does anyone want to add anything?\" which always ends in prolonged silence.",
                "secondBlock": "You're not alone. Maintaining engagement and participation in virtual meetings is a challenge many of us face in this digital age. But don't worry! There are super creative ways to improve this.",

                "icebreakers": "1. Icebreakers",
                "fourthBlock": "Start your meetings with icebreakers. These are very useful strategic tools for kicking off a session, especially online, aiming to build trust and energize the group. They're not just for breaking the ice, but also stimulate creativity from the start.",
                "fifthBlock": "A good icebreaker is like coffee in the morning: necessary to wake up and warm up. üê†",
                "surveys": "2. Polls",
                "sixthBlock": "Incorporate live polls to collect instant opinions and preferences. Polls can be about the meeting's theme or for breaking the ice. They work great for giving a voice to all attendees, thereby increasing participation. For example, you can launch a poll about the favorite snack for meetings or the best meme of the month. Polls are like the GPS of a meeting, telling you where people are at and keeping everyone on track. The best part is that everyone feels like they're piloting! You can do this with tools like Kahoot, Butter, or Google Forms.",
                "seventhBlock": "3. Agenda and Schedule",
                "eighthBlock": "Share a detailed agenda before the meeting. Make sure it's clear, concise, and highlights the key points and specific times for each topic. This helps participants prepare and keeps the meeting focused and efficient.",
                "reactions": "4. Reactions",
                "ninthBlock": "Encourage participants to use reactions during the meeting. Use reactions like confetti at a carnival: let the thumbs-ups and hearts fly when something is cool. It's the quickest way to say \"That's it!\" without interrupting the flow. At Stooa, we often start sessions by asking a question and asking participants to answer with reactions. You could ask which they would prefer: *never being able to listen to music again* üëé, or *having to listen to music all the time* üëç, and ask them to react with a thumbs up or down.",
                "fishbowl": "5. Fishbowl",
                "eleventhBlock": "The Fishbowl dynamic allows you to stop being the person facilitating the session and focus on the conversation and insights gained. This dynamic focuses on improving the <1>flow of dialogue</1>, and activates participation by giving all attendees the chance to actively participate.",
                "howItWorks": "How does it work?",
                "twelfthBlock": "The Fishbowl is like an aquarium for bright ideas. Imagine you're in an online meeting, and instead of everyone speaking at once (total chaos!), some participants are in the \"aquarium\" (the Fishbowl itself) sharing their ideas while the rest observe and listen attentively. Participants inside the aquarium rotate, ensuring everyone has the chance to dive into the center of the action.",

                "listItem1": "Perfect Balance: Everyone gets their moment in the spotlight, avoiding the chaos of speaking at the same time.",
