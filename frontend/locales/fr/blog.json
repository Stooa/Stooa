                "secondBlock": "You're not alone. Maintaining <span>participation</span> and <span>commitment</span> in online meetings is a mission many of us face in this digital era. But don't worry! There are super creative ways to improve this.",

                "fourthBlock": "Start your meetings with an icebreaker. They are very useful strategic tools to start a session, especially online, with the aim of building trust and <span>energizing the group</span>, and they do more than just break the ice; they also allow you to <span>stimulate creativity</span> from the beginning. A simple example could be asking participants to share their desktop background and the story behind it.",

                "sixthBlock": "Incorporate live polls to collect instant opinions and preferences. Polls can be about the theme of the meeting or to break the ice. They work very well to <span>give a voice to all attendees</span>, thus increasing participation.<br/>For example, you could launch a poll about the favorite snack for meetings or the best meme of the month. Polls are like the GPS of the meeting, they tell you where people are going and keep everyone on course. And the best thing is that everyone feels like they are piloting!",

                "ninthBlock": "Encourage participants to use reactions during the meeting. Use reactions like confetti at a carnival: let the thumbs up and hearts fly when something is cool. <span>It's the fastest way to say \"That's it!\" without interrupting the flow</span>.<br/>At Stooa, we usually start sessions by throwing out a question and asking participants to respond with reactions. You could ask what they would prefer between two things, for example: never being able to listen to music again üëé, or having to listen to music all the time üëç, and ask them to react with a thumbs up or down.",

Imagine that you are in an online meeting, and instead of everyone talking at once (total chaos!), some participants are in the \"aquarium\" (the Fishbowl itself) <span>sharing their ideas</span> while the rest observe and listen attentively. Participants in the aquarium rotate, ensuring that everyone has the chance to dive into the center of the action.",

Arrange participants in an inner circle (where the debate takes place) and an outer circle (where they observe the debate) within the virtual space. Anyone from the outer circle can freely enter the inner circle whenever they need to contribute their perspective to the conversation. This facilitates participation in a fluid and organised manner <span>without the need for moderation</span>, allowing the conversation to remain <span>focused on the central topic</span> and encouraging diversity of voices involved.",
